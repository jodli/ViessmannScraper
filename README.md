# ViessmannScraper

This is used to read data from my Viessmann Heater Unit.

It is used in conjunction with the [vcontrold](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcontrold/) service which is running on a Raspberry Pi.

The data will (soonâ„¢) be read from the vcontrold telnet interface and saved into my [HomeMonitoring](https://github.com/jodli/HomeMonitoring) Influx Database.
